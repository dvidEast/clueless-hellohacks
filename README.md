## Solving Amazon's Unsolvable Problem

The fashion game has been revolutionized by the e-commerce world, and tech giants like Amazon, Zara, and Lululemon earn millions in revenue from online shoppers looking to by clothing online. However, one of the largest issues that the market faces is the one thing driving the entire business, a screen and the internet. People want to try on clothes before buying them - everyone is different; different body shapes, heights, sizes, colours - no model can replicate what an article of clothing is going to look like on the individual. There's a reason why people still go to stores in person to buy clothes, even if buying clothes online is much more efficient (and some would say more fun). This is where we come in, we're going to bridge that gap using a 3d rendered modle of you that you can try different clothes on!
